This is the repository for the Computer Systems First Year 2020 Game Project, Meosphere, for University of Limerick Module CS4043. As a first-time game project 🎓, it is built using the [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) Game Engine, formerly known as the Corona engine, and is available for Windows and Android platforms.

🎮 MeoSphere is a fun and engaging high-score-based game where you launch the Meosphere, a catball, as far as you can, helping it eat as much food as possible along the way. To build up speed before launching, tap the screen as fast as you can. The further you go, the more points you earn for permanent upgrades in the store. Throughout the game, you can collect various power-ups such as the catnip power-up 🌿 for a speed boost or the boot power-up 👢 to gain a sudden increase in height.
